# 350 Adversarial Multi-turn Conversations #

This dataset is part of the DICES dataset and consists of multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human raters interacting with a dialog model and then rated with safety labels. It contains 350 adversarial dialog conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 123 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with five safety top-level categories (i.e. harmful content, content with unfair bias, misinformation, political affiliation and safety policy guidelines) and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited for a balanced representation by gender (man or woman), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latine, Asian, Multiracial). Each rater rated all items. The total rows in this dataset are: 43050.

**NB:** the results presented in the papers typically deal with 104 unique raters in the rater pool (after applying our rater quality criteria). However, in the released data we provide all ratings from all 123 raters in case other researchers want to apply a different strategy for quality of raters.

Each row of the dataset represents the collection of ratings by one rater on one conversation, or in other words all the ratings on a (rater, conversation) pair. The field **rater_id** indicates the rater and the field **item_id** indicates the conversation (see description of all fields below). 
Here are a few useful python recipes for viewing the data. 

Load the data into pandas.
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("diverse_safety_adversarial_dialog_350.csv")
```

View all ratings associated with one conversation.
```
df[df.item_id == 193]
```

List all unique conversations.
```
df.drop_duplicates(subset="item_id")
```

List all unique raters.
```
df.drop_duplicates(subset="rater_id")
```

## Overview of annotation fields ## 
- **Field 1** is an id unique to each (rater, conversation) pair
- **Fields 2-8** provide metadata about raters
- **Fields 9-13** provide metadata about conversations, and (10-11) about the time it took each rater to rate it. 
- **Fields 14-17** contain the expert annotations for harm type, degree of harm, safety gold label and safety gold label comment
- **Fields 18-37** contain all the granular safety ratings from individual raters
- **Fields 38-41** contain aggregated safety ratings from all the ratings from all raters per conversation

## Dataset Schema ##
1. `id`: numerical identifier for each row, representing all ratings by a single rater to a single conversation.
2. `rater_id`: numerical identifier for each rater.
3. `rater_gender`: “Man”, “Woman” the gender of the rater
4. `rater_race`: The race/ethnicity of the rater (five categories).
5. `rater_raw_race`: The self-reported raw race/ethnicity of the rater, before simplification to five categories.
6. `rater_age`: “gen z,” “millenial,” “gen x+” the age group of the rater.
7. `rater_education`: “College degree or higher,” “High school or below.”
8. `phase`: one of two distinct time periods (Phase3).
9. `item_id`: numerical identifier for each conversation.
10. `answer_time_ms`: amount of time spent by each rater on each safety annotation question.
11. `answer_timestamp`: time when each conversation was rated by each rater.
12. `context`: the conversation turns before the final chatbot response.
13. `response`: the final chatbot response in the conversation.
14. `degree_of_harm`: “Benign”, “Debatable”, “Extreme”, or “Moderate" hand-annotated rating of severity of safety risk.  
15. `harm_type`: hand-annotated harm topic of conversation. List that is drawn from a set of 25 different harm topics.
16. `safety_gold`: “Yes”, “No" the gold standard safety label provided by experts. 
17. `safety_gold_reason`: the reason(s) (if given) for the gold safety label provided by experts. See below for mapping these values to the granular safety ratings.
18. `Q1_whole_conversation_evaluation`: rating about the understandability of a conversation (four categories): (1) is the conversation nonsensical, (2) is the conversation in a language other than English, (3) is the rater not familiar with the topics of the conversation, (4) none of the above - the conversation makes sense, it is in English and the rater is familiar with the topic.
